üåç Civic Issue Classifier ‚Äì Description

The CivicAI SIH Project is an AI-powered civic issue reporting and management platform designed to make cities smarter, more efficient, and responsive to citizen needs.

In today‚Äôs world, a large number of urban challenges such as garbage accumulation, potholes, broken streetlights, water logging, and floods often go unnoticed or take too long to resolve due to delays in reporting and lack of proper routing to the right departments. CivicAI bridges this gap by allowing citizens to simply upload a photo of an issue.

Once an image is uploaded, the platform leverages the YOLOv8 deep learning model to automatically classify the type of civic problem. The model has been trained on thousands of images and can recognize issues with high accuracy. After classification, the system intelligently maps each issue to the relevant department:

Garbage ‚Üí Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs / Sanitation Department

Potholes ‚Üí Roads and Transport Department

Streetlight Failures ‚Üí Electricity Department

Water Logging ‚Üí Municipal Water Management

Floods ‚Üí Disaster Management Authority / Water Resources Department

This ensures that the complaint does not remain in a general pool but is instead directly assigned to the correct authority for faster redressal.

Additionally, the system provides prediction probabilities and confidence scores to maintain transparency and trust in AI-based decision-making. Each report is saved and logged in a structured format (CSV or database) for tracking, analytics, and follow-up actions.

The CivicAI platform goes beyond just classification‚Äîit creates a smart grievance redressal pipeline where citizens, municipal authorities, and government departments work in sync. By automating classification and routing, the system reduces manual effort, shortens response times, and improves accountability.

This project not only demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence in solving real-world problems but also has the potential to scale across multiple cities and states, making civic governance more efficient and citizen-friendly.

In essence, CivicAI empowers citizens, strengthens governance, and contributes toward building the Smart Cities of the future.
